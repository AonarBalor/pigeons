# TODO
- [ ] Real Lisp
    - [x] Parse sexprs into AST tables 
    - [ ] Persist AST tables as sexprs
- [ ] Load configuration from file
    - [x] Load .plisp as listener implementation
    - [x] Assign .plisp via config
    - [ ] Use named ports (e.g. Faderfox/Launchpad) when available
    - [ ] Use virtual MIDI ports instead of real IDs
- [ ] Convenience functions
    - [ ] Channel-changing
    - [ ] Message-mapping
    - [ ] Note/CC matching
    - [ ] Inclusive ranges (thinking ".." for the fn name)
- [ ] Refactor exec to create child envs
- [ ] Collate TODOs from code
- [ ] Rethink lens modes - they're cheesy
    - [ ] Conditions + state is more useful
- [ ] ("Spike") Investigate norns `sky` lib, see if it can replace some code
- [ ] Refactor everything to use plisp as much as possible
- [ ] Implement UI
    - [ ] Visual (keyboard-free) expression editor
    - [ ] Message "learn" (like MIDI learn)
- [ ] Add debug mode
- [ ] Refactor for library usage
    - [ ] Do not reference other modules via globals
    - [ ] Messages and plisp MAY be useful separately (?)
- [ ] Implement message throttling
    - [ ] Timers/clocks
    - [ ] Execution context (like closure env) - may need IDs, etc.
- [ ] Add engine support
- [ ] Add norns params read/write support
    - [ ] This has its own MIDI mappings
