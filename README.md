## Lensing
MIDI mapping is an all but necessary evil of music hardware. The lenses of
pigeons are descriptive names for parameters. Instead of referencing
implementation charts and awkwardly dialing in 7-bit values, let's take the
friendly names and leave the rest.

Where the names align is common understanding. A filter cutoff is a filter
cutoff by any other CC number. 

As long as we can forget byte identifiers, why not forget protocol? MIDI is
only an implementation detail. Where appropriate, OSC and CV can be, too.

## Lisp
Lisp is sometimes described as "code as configuration".

What is a patch but the configuration of a synthesis system?

If one configures a synth with knobs and buttons, perhaps one can also code
with them. Where knobs fall short, tried-and-true text picks up the slack.

## The dream
As the byte-mappings dissolve, the words follow quickly behind. Let's further
erase the boundaries between preparing and jamming, programming and using,
sequencing and playing by hand.
